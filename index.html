		<p>I studied kinder at <b>Abakadang Kayumanggi Learning Center</b> and I graduated with honors. After that, I studied elementary at <b>Morning Breeze Elementary School</b>. Every grade I was always in the "Top Students". When I was Grade 5 and 6, I participated the Science Quiz Bee at our school and won 1st place. And I graduated Elementary with Honors. Then I went to junior highschool in <b>St. Michael Learning Center Inc.</b> There, I met most of my friends. We did all sorts of shenanigans and it was fun. They say that the high school llfe is the most fun, and I can definitely say that is true. I also participated in different Quiz Bees at our high school and also won. And then I finally finished junior highschool with honors still. I studied Senior High School at <b>ACTEC Caloocan</b>. I also finished Grade 11 and Grade 12 with honors. And now I am currently a 1st year college student in <b>Global Reciprocal Colleges</b>. My course is B.S. Information Technology. My current objective is to graduate from college with high grades by studying hard. Once that is done, I will finally get a decent job with a high salary.</b></p>
